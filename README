This is my Final Project for IDF's programming course.

In this project I used a version of the project “Worlds Hardest Game” made by “kreichek” as a game to solve using genetics algorithm:
https://github.com/kreichek/hardest-game-editor

the goals of this project are:
-Learn Python programming language
-Research the topic of Genetic Algorithms
-Add Artificial Intelligence support to the game “worlds hardest game”
-Prove difficult levels solvable
-Provide a tool for humans that shows the solutions to the various levels

this projects builds on kreichek's game and adds a genetic algorithm that solves the levels
and shows what is the correct way to approach a level

demonstration of the solutions the algorithm came up with for each level:

one of the levels being solved live:

feel free to download it and play with the genetics algorithm values, and try and improve the algorithm!

To run the project, compile the file “hardest-game-editor.py” (Python 2.7).
The only dependency to run the game is pygame, which is a Python module that can be downloaded here: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.


This is my Fundamentals of Programming (15-112 - Fall 2013) term project at Carnegie Mellon University. It is a re-creation of the popular flash game "The World's Hardest Game." In addition to a fully functional game, it includes a level editor that can be used to create a large variety of different levels to play. Detailed instructions on how to actually use the program can be found under Instructions in the main menu of the program.

To run the project, compile the file “hardest-game-editor.py” (Python 2.7).

The only dependency to run the game is pygame, which is a Python module that can be downloaded here: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.
