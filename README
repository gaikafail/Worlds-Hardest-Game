This is my Final Project for IDF's programming course.

In this project I used a version of the project “Worlds Hardest Game” made by “kreichek” as a game to solve using genetics algorithm:
https://github.com/kreichek/hardest-game-editor

the goals of this project are:
-Learn Python programming language
-Research the topic of Genetic Algorithms
-Add Artificial Intelligence support to the game “worlds hardest game”
-Prove difficult levels solvable
-Provide a tool for humans that shows the solutions to the various levels

this projects builds on kreichek's game and adds a genetic algorithm that solves the levels
and shows what is the correct way to approach a level

demonstration of the solutions the algorithm came up with for each level:

one of the levels being solved live:

feel free to download it and play with the genetics algorithm values, and try and improve the algorithm!

To run the project, compile the file “hardest-game-editor.py” (Python 2.7).
The only dependency to run the game is pygame, which is a Python module that can be downloaded here: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml.
